# maze
**This project was made for the Fall 2019 semester of CS 225 at UIUC**

This project contains code and tests for a program that creates mazes and also gives the solutions to these mazes. 

## Functionality
The goal of this project was to use disjoint sets in order to split maze tiles up and connect them to form one set, which in turn creates the maze. 
With the completed maze breadth-first search was then used in order to find the solution of the recently created maze.

## Contents
In this project the following files contained code that was written by me:
* dsets.cpp
* dsets.h
* main.cpp
* maze.cpp
* maze.h

All other files were not written by me, but by the course staff of CS 225
